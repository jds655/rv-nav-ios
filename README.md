## API's & SDK's

### ArcGIS RunTime SDK

[ArcGIS](https://developers.arcgis.com/ios/) is a mapping platform that allows for the calling and plotting of a user specified route. It also presents functionality to avoid specific hazards related to a vehicles height, weight, length and other relevant factors. 

### SideMenu

[SideMenu]( https://github.com/jonkykong/SideMenu) Simple side/slide menu control for iOS, no code necessary! Lots of customization.

### Google Sign In

[Google Sign In](https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/ios/start-integrating) allows our users to sign in with Google.

### Facebook Sign In

[Facebook Sign In](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/ios) allows our users to sign in with Facebook.

### Drop Down

[DropDown](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/ios) when our users are selecting a vehicle, this gives our users a nice drop down menu.
